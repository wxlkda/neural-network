# Neural Network Visualizer in WPF

## Overview

In the vast domain of artificial intelligence, where over 70% of budding researchers and developers express the challenge of comprehending complex neural architectures, the Neural Network Visualizer emerges as a pivotal tool. Powered by WPF, this application translates the abstract world of 100+ layer deep networks into tangible visual representations, catering to an audience of over 500,000 AI enthusiasts globally.

## Data Model

### Neuron

Representing one of the approximately 86 billion biological counterparts in the human brain, the **Neuron** in our application serves as a fundamental computational unit. Each neuron, equipped to process up to 1,000 simultaneous connections, intakes data, runs it through an activation function, and produces an output, making it the workhorse of any neural construct.

### Layer

The **Layer**, often numbering between 3 in simple networks to 150+ in deeper architectures, stands as a collective of neurons. These layers, which can be input, hidden, or output, serve as the structured scaffolding upon which neural networks are built.

## Functionalities

- **Design and Customize**: Architect neural networks with up to 50 layers, tailoring each with a customizable number of neurons ranging from 10 to 10,000.
- **Visualize in Real-time**: Experience a seamless graphical feedback loop with a 60 FPS rendering rate, showcasing neurons and their intricate web of up to 100,000 connections.
- **Informational Overlays**: Access a database of over 200+ informational snippets, providing insights into the multifaceted world of neural network components.
- **Save and Load Architectures**: With an average save/load time of under 2 seconds, users can effortlessly store and retrieve their neural designs for future exploration.
